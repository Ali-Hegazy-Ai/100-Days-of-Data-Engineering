This repository documents my 100 day learning journey into Data Engineering. It is both a personal study log and a public learning resource for anyone who wants to follow the same path or explore core data engineering concepts in a structured way. The material follows three DataCamp career tracks and includes daily notes, exercises, code samples, and small projects.
