# 100 Days of Data Engineering

This repository documents my 100 day learning journey into Data Engineering. It serves as a personal study log and a public resource for anyone who wants to follow a similar path. The material is based on three DataCamp learning tracks: Data Engineering Associate, Data Engineer, and Professional Data Engineer.

The tracks cover core topics such as:
- Data modeling
- SQL for analytics and OLTP systems
- Python for data processing
- ETL and ELT workflows
- Orchestration and scheduling
- Warehousing and storage systems
- Distributed computing
- Cloud deployment patterns
- Data quality and observability

## Purpose

The repository has two purposes. The first is to help me internalize Data Engineering concepts through daily documentation and hands-on exercises. The second is to provide a transparent and reusable learning path for other students or professionals who want to explore the field.

## What is in this repository

The contents include:
- Daily notes and insights
- Concept explanations
- Terminology and definitions
- SQL and Python exercises
- References and links
- Small project work
- Observations and study reflections

This repository evolves over the 100 days from foundational topics toward more complex pipeline and deployment work. It is not intended to be a polished tutorial but rather a structured record of real learning and practice. Feel free to read, clone, reuse, or adapt material for your own learning.
