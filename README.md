This repository documents my 100 day learning journey into Data Engineering. It is both a personal study log and a public learning resource for anyone who wants to follow the same path or explore core data engineering concepts in a structured way. The material follows three DataCamp career tracks and includes daily notes, exercises, code samples, and small projects.

## DataCamp Tracks Used

| Track | Link |
|-------|------|
| Associate Data Engineer in SQL | [View on DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-engineer-in-sql) |
| Data Engineer in Python | [View on DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-engineer-in-python) |

## Purpose

- Record what I learn each day with notes and examples.
- Convert course material into reusable reference notes and small projects.
- Provide a public, transparent resource that other learners can read, clone, or adapt.

> **Note:** This is not a polished tutorial. It is a working log that records definitions, code, experiments, mistakes, and corrections as I move from fundamentals to more advanced workflows.

## What is in This Repository

- Daily notes and study summaries in markdown
- Concept explanations and terminology lists
- SQL and Python practice files and snippets
- Small project folders and example pipelines
- References, links, and external resources
- A progress tracker for the three DataCamp tracks
