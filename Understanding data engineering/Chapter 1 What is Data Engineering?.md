	How data flows (Data workflow)
		1. Data collection and stroage
		2. data preparation
		3. explioraiotn and visualizaiotn
		4. expreimanton & prediciton
	Data engieer are repsoinpbe for step 1
	Data engineers:
	they delivere data in the right form ,correct data to right people as efficlty as psosible they ingest data from disferen source optimze databses for anyalise remove courrpeted data,develpoe,,construct,test main ata architechutres

	Big data bceomcs e the noram ==> more data eng
	The 5 Fvs
		1. volume how much
		2. variaty what kind
		3. veclocity how frequent
		4. varacity how accurate
		5. value how usefell
Data engineers vs data sceincets:
	Data engieenrs: colelct and storage
	data scients preapre the data explore the daata  ,experimentaiotn & prediction

| Data Engineer        | Data Scientist    |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| ingest,store data    | exploit data      |
| setup databases      | access databasses |
| build data pipelines |                   |
The Data pipeline:
we Ingest,process,store to do that we need pipelines they automate the flow they enfure an eeficiatn flow of data,extract,trans,from,valid,laod,transform,they reduece
etl and tapiples,
ETL extract data,tansformdata.3load .
